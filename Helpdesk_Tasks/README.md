##My Journey into Helpdesk Code##
Hi there! Welcome to my journey into creating code for various helpdesk responsibilities. I am a beginner in coding and I have created this repository to document my progress and share resources with others.

#Why Code?#
As a helpdesk technician, I am responsible for managing customer inquiries and troubleshooting technical issues. I have found that creating scripts and tools that automate common tasks and provide quick solutions to frequently asked questions can be incredibly helpful in streamlining my work.

This repository is designed to provide resources and code examples specifically tailored to helpdesk technicians. I will explore common helpdesk scenarios and provide PowerShell scripts that can help streamline these processes.

#Getting Started#
If you are new to PowerShell, there are many resources available online to help you get started. Microsoft provides excellent documentation and tutorials on their website, and there are many books and online courses available as well.

Once you have a basic understanding of PowerShell, you can start exploring the sample code in this repository. The code is organized by scenario, and each folder contains PowerShell scripts that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.
